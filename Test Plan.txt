1. Power tree: Plugging in the board and verifying that 3.3V comes out of the digital and RF LDOs

2. Basic Digital Check: Attempting to flash simple code to the RP2040 that will blink the onboard LED
    - should validate everything besides the RF chain/control

3. Synth Programming: Attempting to communicate with the PLL over SPI and changing register values to attempt to see an RF signal out (all other devices can be in the default state)
    - broad test, just want to see SOMETHING come out at the right freququency

RF Chain Programming: Communicating with variable attenuators, and switches, exercising all RF chain options, both manually and through software

Power Amplifier: Biasing the PA and testing small signal gain, matching if necessary

Networking Code: Finalizing code for transmitting PRBS OOK and setting the RF chain into different states
